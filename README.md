# Data Science Project

## Overview

This project aims to address a specific problem using a data-driven approach, leveraging both traditional statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques. The project is structured into two main parts, covering the full spectrum of the data analytics lifecycle from problem formulation to operationalization.

## Objectives

- To define and understand the problem through exploratory data analysis.
- To preprocess and clean the dataset for analysis.
- To select and implement appropriate models to address the problem.
- To evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
- To operationalize the models for production deployment.

## Technical Specifications

- **Programming Languages**: Python and R
- **Tools and Libraries**: Jupyter Notebook, numpy, sklearn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, optional visualization tools.
- **Data Processing**: Data cleansing, normalization/standardization, feature engineering.
- **Modeling Techniques**: kNN algorithm (from scratch), Supervised Learning models, Ensemble models, Deep Learning models, Clustering algorithms.

## Deliverables

1. **Mid-journey Report** and **Final Report** documenting the process and insights.
2. **Executive Summary** for non-technical stakeholders.
3. **Code**: R and Python, well-commented and documented.
4. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing Notebook**.
5. **Modeling Notebook**.
6. **Codebase** for reproducibility.
7. **Trained Models** in a zip folder.
